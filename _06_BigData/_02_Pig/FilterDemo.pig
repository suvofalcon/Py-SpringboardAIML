-- Lets load the file
-- PigStorage can be used to load various types of files
-- PigStorage (',') denotes that the value is delimited with ','

-- We will apply a filter criteria and would have only those records in the relation where dividend is 0
nyse_filtered = FILTER nyse_dividends BY dividends == 0.00;

-- Now for all the stocks which has not given dividends, lets convert the stock symbol to lower and output the same
nyse_lower = FOREACH nyse_filtered GENERATE LOWER(symbol) as lower_stockSymbols;
